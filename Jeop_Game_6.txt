FAQ:
Q. How do I reset the links on the main board back to yellow?
A. Simply close the PowerPoint file, and re-open, and the links will turn back to yellow.

Q. Can I use this in Keynote / Google Slides / Open Office?
A. Sorry, but Google slides, Keynote, Open Office etc. are not supported. Those are great programs but they’re not made to handle a file with this animation complexity.

Q. Why aren’t the sound effects working?
A. If the sound effects aren’t working, I would suggest upgrading your PowerPoint to something newer than 2008, and using a PC instead of a Mac if possible. Also, Google slides, Keynotes, etc. are not supported.

Q. Can I get a board with less categories? Can I add a custom logo?
A. Unfortunately these changes are a little too complex for me to explain or assist you via email, but if you’d like me to do a custom job for you for a small fee, send me an email at Reid@youthdownloads.com. You can also try using an App I made called TriviaMaker which lets you easily create Jeopardy style games and customize the number of categories, colors and logo at www.TriviaMaker.com
